								<p>In recent years, Taiwan once again becomes a worldwide focus due to global politics.
									I have been to Taiwan only once during a one-month visiting program to Chinese
									Culture University (Taipei) in 2013, and I have been so fascinated by the natural
									and cultural landscape of this beautiful island. This non-political map aims at
									revealing the physical and cultural wonders of Taiwan. Putting aside all the
									disputes, let us simply cherish the beauty and peace of this scenic island, Formosa.
									As we learned in cartography class, all maps are politics and no map could be truly
									non-political, but I really wish to invite broader audiences from all over the
									world, to know more about this beautiful island, just like what its original name
									means, Formosa.<br><br>
									In this map, all the designs serve for one purpose: to reveal the
									beauty of this island, and get rid of politics. Different from regular "North-Up"
									map, this map uses orthographic projection, imitating a bird view from space. It
									might happen to look like viewing from mainland China, but arguably, this
									perspective has nothing to do with politics, but simply because of the nature: the
									overall shape of the island runs north-to-northeast and south-to-southwest, and its
									general topographic pattern is flat on the west and hilly on the east. Non-political
									does not mean non-humanistic, so this map also cares about people living in Taiwan,
									especially the local indigenous populations. Additionally, this is a "trilingual"
									map, or a map "In Three Scripts".</p>

								<p>Below is a much detailed version of introduction with cartographic
									techniques:<br><br>
									<b>[Projection]</b><br>
									Different from regular “North-Up” map, this map uses orthographic “World From Space”
									projection, imitating a bird view from space. It might happen to look like viewing
									from mainland China, but arguably, this perspective has nothing to do with politics,
									but simply because of the nature: the overall shape of the island runs
									north-to-northeast and south-to-southwest, and its general topographic pattern is
									flat on the west and hilly on the east. Therefore, this specific perspective could
									better display the terrain while still partly keeping the north-south direction so
									that audience would not totally get lost. On the bottom-right corner, a specially
									designed scalebar is put alongside with the graticule to indicate the directions and
									distances simultaneously. Additionally, the map extent is subtly set to minimize the
									potential political controversies.
									<br><br>
									<b>[Locator Map]</b><br>
									To better illustrate this unusual map projection, the locator map (globe) on the
									bottom-left also displays the extent of the main map. In agreement with the
									apolitical theme, the locator map only labels the physical features, such as the
									marine areas (oceans, seas, straits), islands, peninsulas, and the globe graticule.
									The locator map’s light hillshade on lands is simply an ArcGIS Online layer.
									<br><br>
									<b>[Terrain]</b><br>
									The highlight of this map is undoubtedly the shaded terrain. The eye-catching
									hillshade is rendered after various steps based on the 30-meter Digital Elevation
									Model (DEM) data. Specifically, it is a combination of 20 layers, including the raw
									DEM layer, 5 blurred DEM layers, 6 slope layers, 6 hillshade layers, 1 slope
									hillshade layer, and a satellite imagery layer. They are delicately displayed in a
									specific order, with different settings of blend mode (normal, luminosity, overlay,
									soft light, multiply) and opacity, leading to this adorable rendering. In terms of
									the specific techniques, great credit should be attributed to Esri’s cartographer
									John Nelson, whose articles and videos about hillshade rendering help lay a solid
									foundation of this hillshade. Additionally, a generalized dashed contour line layer
									is displayed at a 1000-meter step, and for the bathymetry, several isobaths are
									generalized and displayed together with the pre-rendered bathymetric hillshade
									layer.
									<br><br>
									<b>[Typography]</b><br>
									The typography of various labels is adjusted according to the various types and
									classes of geographic features, but also modestly enough to minimize its visual
									hierarchy so that the terrain could still pop up enough. Physical features include
									oceans, seas, straits, channels, islands (islets), capes, mountain ranges, mountain
									peaks, volcano groups, hills, plains, basins, plateaus, rivers, lakes (reservoirs),
									etc. Culture features are very mildly labeled, including major cities and harbors.
									All texts of multiple scripts (languages) in this map are using Microsoft YaHei font
									family for visual legibility and aesthetics.
									<br><br>
									<b>[Inset Map]</b><br>
									Non-political does not mean non-humanistic. This map also cares about the people
									living in Taiwan, especially the local indigenous populations. The top-right inset
									map illustrates the distribution of 16 indigenous groups, together with the local
									administrative unit (city and county) of different geographical regions (northern,
									central, southern, eastern).
									<br><br>
									<b>[Element]</b><br>
									As a map focusing on the physical geography, some geographical facts about Taiwan
									are places on the negative space, such as area, area rank, west-east width,
									north-south length, coastline length, highest points, and a brief summary of the
									mountains. The northernmost, southernmost, easternmost and westernmost locations of
									Taiwan Island are also labeled.
									<br><br>
									<b>[Language]</b><br>
									As stated in the title (“In Three Scripts”), all texts are displayed in the order of
									English, Chinese (traditional characters) and Chinese (simplified characters). When
									in some cases the two Chinese scripts are the same, then they will be combined for
									visual simplicity. Properly speaking, the traditional and simplified Chinese
									characters are the two writing forms or scriptures of the same language, therefore
									this map is titled “In Three Scripts” instead of a “Trilingual” one. Note that many
									places in Taiwan have more than one Latinization in spelling at different historical
									times, therefore only the relatively modern and formal one will be adopted in this
									map after careful comparison, for the sake of wider spread in global audiences.
									<br><br>
									<b>[Data Source]</b><br>
									The data source for the terrain hillshade is NASA 30-meter SRTM dataset. Other data
									source includes Esri ArcGIS Online (satellite imagery, water features, bathymetry),
									Wikipedia (geographic facts, multi-lingual names of geographic features), and Taiwan
									Indigenous People’s Knowledge Economic Development Association, etc.
									<br><br>
									<b>[Disclaimer]</b><br>
									I, the only author of this map, am originally from mainland China. I’ve been to
									Taiwan only once during a one-month visiting program to Chinese Culture University
									(Taipei) in 2013, and I have been so fascinated by the natural and cultural
									landscape of this beautiful island. As we learned in cartography class, all maps are
									politics and no map could be truly non-political, but I really wish to invite
									broader audiences from all over the world, to know more about this beautiful island,
									just like what its original name means, Formosa.
									<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="taiwan_earthquake.png" alt="">
									On Apr 3, 2024, a 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit Taiwan, with epicenter at Hualien,
									which is the biggest one on Taiwan's record in last 25 years. I made this news map
									of 2024
									Taiwan Earthquake based on my Taiwan map.
