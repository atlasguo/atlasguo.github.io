								<p>This is a memorial map for my grandfather who passed away in 2023. He was born in a
									peasant family in China
									(1937), and was educated to be a primary school teacher and headmaster for over 40
									years. I was raised by him so
									his death meant a lot to me. <br><br>As a well trained map-maker, I decided to make
									a
									grayscale map in memory of him
									with all my love and memories. Not considering traveling trips, his lifetime
									footprint is basically around my
									hometown, Zibo. Therefore, I use my award-winning (NACIS 2023) map as the base
									layer, and illustrate his lifetime
									footprint on top of it. All fonts are specially chosen to match the memorial theme.
									As an amateur Seal-Carving (a
									type of Chinese calligraphy) artist, I carved a stone seal of my family name in
									memory of my grandfather. It is
									embedded (top-left) and also redesigned into a north arrow (top-right). <br><br>I
									would
									thank my uncle who compiled all
									the tracks of my grandfather. Due to privacy concerns, some Chinese characters are
									covered with mosaics.

									a static map, as the basis for the tangible version. Finally, I used watercolor to
									paint a choropleth layer of % black lynchings on an empty woodboard of contiguous

								<p>Social media platforms such as Twitter with user-generated contents provide great
									potentials to better understand the spatiotemporal and transportation pattern of
									evacuation behaviors during hurricanes. Hurricane Harvey was the costliest tropical
									cyclone on record (tied with Hurricane Katrina of 2005), inflicting roughly $125
									billion in damage across the Houston metropolitan area and Southeast Texas. It
									lasted from about mid-Aug until early Sep 2017, with many records for rainfall and
									landfall intensity set during that time.<br><br>
									<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto"
										src="maps/revealing_hurricane_harvey_partial.jpg" alt="">
									The overall map visualizes the trajectories
									generated based on a Twitter dataset relevant to 2017 Hurricane Harvey. The
									transportation mode (flight vs. drive) is calculated using machine learning
									algorithms considering multiple spatiotemporal and semantic factors, based on
									manually classified ground truth dataset. Technical details of the transportation
									mode detection process are introduced in the corresponding research paper. The four
									stage-specific maps display the aggregated trajectories at CBSA (core-based
									statistical area) level during the 4 stages of Hurricane Harvey correspondingly,
									indicating the connections among major metropolitan areas. Both the line width and
									opacity represent the volume of connections between two cities. Only strong
									connections are displayed, while the weaker ones are hidden.

								<p>This map product is a combination of three geovisualizations about historical
									hurricanes in contiguous U.S. from different perspectives.
									<br><br>
									1. The Panoramic “Hexagon” Map (bottom):
									With orthographic “World From Space” projection, this map lines up the major
									Atlantic coastal area of the U.S. horizontally. Based on 10-square-kilometer hexagon
									unit, the choropleth (color) shows the total number of storms, and the piled bar
									chart (length) shows the storm frequencies in recent 10, 20, 50, 100, and 171 (all
									accessible history) years, correspondingly. Urban area is colored in light gray, and
									necessary labels for major coastal cities are displayed.
									<br><br>
									2. The “Concentric Ring” Map (top-left)
									With same universal unit as the bottom map (10-sq-km hexagon), this map uses
									concentric rings to compare the number of the storm events every decade in recent 50
									years: i.e. the center (core) indicates oldest decade (1970s) and edge ring
									indicates the most recent one (2010s). The darker the ring color is, the more storms
									this hexagon statistical unit has witnessed.
									<br><br>
									3. The “Historic Hurricane Tracks” Map (top-right)
									With all the hurricane tracks’ intensity displayed in different color-width
									combination, the storm category (Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind) is intuitively
									visualized at corresponding location. Storms in recent 20 years have full opacity,
									and various transparency is applied according to its year, imitating the fading out
									history. As for the label typography, black text indicates storms in recent 20
									years, aligned on the right side of coast; grayer text indicates storms earlier,
									aligned on the left side of coast; and additionally, bold text illustrates major
									hurricanes (category-3 and above). The storm’s year is added to the bracket after
									the name, while some historic storms even do not have a name.
									<br><br>
									Additionally, auxiliary elements (graticule, state boundary, ocean basemap) and
									graphic designs (tri-partition layout, gradient effect, drop shadow, universal
									condensed “Acumin” font) are deployed for visual legibility and cartographic
									aesthetics.
									<br><br>
									The major data source is the International Best Track Archive for Climate
									Stewardship (IBTrACS) during 1851 to 2021, providing the location and intensity for
									global tropical cyclones. Additional data sources include U.S. Census Bureau, ArcGIS
									Online, and Esri’s World Ocean Basemap and Light Gray Basemap.

								<h5 class="text-muted">Runner-Up in Thematic Map and Keynotes Choice in WLIA 2024;<br>A

								<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="maps/us_natural_disaster_full.png" alt="">
								<a href="maps/us_natural_disaster_full.png" target="_blank">View Full Image</a>
								<br><br>
								<p>This map presents an innovative and comprehensive visualization of U.S. natural
									disasters of various types, allowing the map readers to acquire information from
									both overview and spatial-semantic specific perspectives.
									<br><br>
									The major eye-catching element in this map would be the multivariate symbol design.
									To evenly divide the space with rooms for multiple visual vehicles, the hexagon unit
									is chosen, which also balances the functionality and aesthetics. The general idea is
									to split each hexagon unit into 6 parts (or 7, including the central one),
									associated with different color hue all around the color wheel. Due to the natural
									of different colors, the lightness (HSL) or value (HSV) are carefully controlled to
									minimize the other potential variations as visual variable.
									<br><br>
									<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="maps/us_natural_disaster_legend1.png"
										alt="">
									There is arguably barely perfect solution to arrange 6 or 7 natural disaster types
									in the order of color wheel spectrum, but efforts are still made to maximize the
									potential cognitive association. For example, red color for wildfire, yellow for
									drought, blue for hurricane; while flood appears at the bottom, earthquake comes
									from the core, etc.
									<br><br>
									The design inspiration actually comes from the old printing effect, such as the dots
									in “halftone”. In CMYK printing, especially those in worse quality, we can still see
									the colorful dots when close enough. But if we take a step back, the dots work
									organically to display an image. Therefore, I originally evenly filled 7 round
									shapes in each hexagon without any overlapping. It turned out though individual
									values are clear to get, the overall visual effect tends to be grayed out too much.
									I kept exploring from this side (no overlapping), all the way to the opposite side
									(entire overlapping of 7 round shapes) which leads to a much clear overall pattern
									but no way to retrieve individual variables. After many tests in printed version, I
									got the current configuration with partial overlapping, keeping a good balance
									between a clear overall pattern and capability of individual variable retrieval.
									<br><br>
									With major designs highly relying on color-hue (even the entire color wheel), this
									map is probably not targeting at communities with color blindness. Even if there
									seems not to be a perfect solution for that, all relevant feedback is highly
									welcomed.
									<br><br>
									<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="maps/us_natural_disaster_legend2.png"
										alt="">
									Besides the color (hue), the opacity of each sub-symbol also variates from full to
									half, representing the record number from FEMA disaster declarations of relevant
									disaster type. To better understand the social effect of the natural disasters, the
									population density is illustrated in different shade levels of hexagon edges.
									Additionally, the univariate maps are also provided on the left side for further
									exploration.
									<br><br>
									The statistical units in 1000 sq mile hexagon are generated under North America
									Albers equivalent projection, targeting at presenting both the contiguous part and
									two outside states. Some computing strategies are applied during the data processing
									procedure of disaster related variables and the population density. Though the data
									processing and analytics are much less important than the efforts on symbol design,
									everything is seriously treated as expected.
									<br><br>
									Major data source: FEMA disaster declaration summaries, NOAA storm event database,
									USGS historic earthquakes, NOAA NIDIS Drought.GOV, Esri ArcGIS Online and Living
									Atlas.

								<p>In recent years, Taiwan once again becomes a worldwide focus due to global politics.
									I have been to Taiwan only once during a one-month visiting program to Chinese
									Culture University (Taipei) in 2013, and I have been so fascinated by the natural
									and cultural landscape of this beautiful island. This non-political map aims at
									revealing the physical and cultural wonders of Taiwan. Putting aside all the
									disputes, let us simply cherish the beauty and peace of this scenic island, Formosa.
									As we learned in cartography class, all maps are politics and no map could be truly
									non-political, but I really wish to invite broader audiences from all over the
									world, to know more about this beautiful island, just like what its original name
									means, Formosa.<br><br>
									In this map, all the designs serve for one purpose: to reveal the
									beauty of this island, and get rid of politics. Different from regular "North-Up"
									map, this map uses orthographic projection, imitating a bird view from space. It
									might happen to look like viewing from mainland China, but arguably, this
									perspective has nothing to do with politics, but simply because of the nature: the
									overall shape of the island runs north-to-northeast and south-to-southwest, and its
									general topographic pattern is flat on the west and hilly on the east. Non-political
									does not mean non-humanistic, so this map also cares about people living in Taiwan,
									especially the local indigenous populations. Additionally, this is a "trilingual"
									map, or a map "In Three Scripts".</p>

									projection, imitating a bird view from space. It might happen to look like viewing
									from mainland China, but arguably, this perspective has nothing to do with politics,
									but simply because of the nature: the overall shape of the island runs
									north-to-northeast and south-to-southwest, and its general topographic pattern is
									flat on the west and hilly on the east. Therefore, this specific perspective could
									better display the terrain while still partly keeping the north-south direction so
									that audience would not totally get lost. On the bottom-right corner, a specially
									designed scalebar is put alongside with the graticule to indicate the directions and
									distances simultaneously. Additionally, the map extent is subtly set to minimize the
									potential political controversies.
									<br><br>
									[Locator Map]<br>
									To better illustrate this unusual map projection, the locator map (globe) on the
									bottom-left also displays the extent of the main map. In agreement with the
									apolitical theme, the locator map only labels the physical features, such as the
									marine areas (oceans, seas, straits), islands, peninsulas, and the globe graticule.
									The locator map’s light hillshade on lands is simply an ArcGIS Online layer.
									<br><br>
									[Terrain]<br>
									The highlight of this map is undoubtedly the shaded terrain. The eye-catching
									hillshade is rendered after various steps based on the 30-meter Digital Elevation
									Model (DEM) data. Specifically, it is a combination of 20 layers, including the raw
									DEM layer, 5 blurred DEM layers, 6 slope layers, 6 hillshade layers, 1 slope
									hillshade layer, and a satellite imagery layer. They are delicately displayed in a
									specific order, with different settings of blend mode (normal, luminosity, overlay,
									soft light, multiply) and opacity, leading to this adorable rendering. In terms of
									the specific techniques, great credit should be attributed to Esri’s cartographer
									John Nelson, whose articles and videos about hillshade rendering help lay a solid
									foundation of this hillshade. Additionally, a generalized dashed contour line layer
									is displayed at a 1000-meter step, and for the bathymetry, several isobaths are
									generalized and displayed together with the pre-rendered bathymetric hillshade
									layer.
									<br><br>
									[Typography]<br>
									The typography of various labels is adjusted according to the various types and
									classes of geographic features, but also modestly enough to minimize its visual
									hierarchy so that the terrain could still pop up enough. Physical features include
									oceans, seas, straits, channels, islands (islets), capes, mountain ranges, mountain
									peaks, volcano groups, hills, plains, basins, plateaus, rivers, lakes (reservoirs),
									etc. Culture features are very mildly labeled, including major cities and harbors.
									All texts of multiple scripts (languages) in this map are using Microsoft YaHei font
									family for visual legibility and aesthetics.
									<br><br>
									[Inset Map]<br>
									Non-political does not mean non-humanistic. This map also cares about the people
									living in Taiwan, especially the local indigenous populations. The top-right inset
									map illustrates the distribution of 16 indigenous groups, together with the local
									administrative unit (city and county) of different geographical regions (northern,
									central, southern, eastern).
									<br><br>
									[Element]<br>
									As a map focusing on the physical geography, some geographical facts about Taiwan
									are places on the negative space, such as area, area rank, west-east width,
									north-south length, coastline length, highest points, and a brief summary of the
									mountains. The northernmost, southernmost, easternmost and westernmost locations of
									Taiwan Island are also labeled.
									<br><br>
									[Language]<br>
									As stated in the title (“In Three Scripts”), all texts are displayed in the order of
									English, Chinese (traditional characters) and Chinese (simplified characters). When
									in some cases the two Chinese scripts are the same, then they will be combined for
									visual simplicity. Properly speaking, the traditional and simplified Chinese
									characters are the two writing forms or scriptures of the same language, therefore
									this map is titled “In Three Scripts” instead of a “Trilingual” one. Note that many
									places in Taiwan have more than one Latinization in spelling at different historical
									times, therefore only the relatively modern and formal one will be adopted in this
									map after careful comparison, for the sake of wider spread in global audiences.
									<br><br>
									[Data Source]<br>
									The data source for the terrain hillshade is NASA 30-meter SRTM dataset. Other data
									source includes Esri ArcGIS Online (satellite imagery, water features, bathymetry),
									Wikipedia (geographic facts, multi-lingual names of geographic features), and Taiwan
									Indigenous People’s Knowledge Economic Development Association, etc.
									<br><br>
									<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="maps/taiwan_graphic.jpg" alt="">
									[Disclaimer]<br>
									I, the only author of this map, am originally from mainland China. I’ve been to
									Taiwan only once during a one-month visiting program to Chinese Culture University
									(Taipei) in 2013, and I have been so fascinated by the natural and cultural
									landscape of this beautiful island. As we learned in cartography class, all maps are
									politics and no map could be truly non-political, but I really wish to invite
									broader audiences from all over the world, to know more about this beautiful island,
									just like what its original name means, Formosa.

								<p>This made-up map is designed in memory of the quarantine period for COVID-19 pandemic
									in 2020, during which my wife and I seldom went outdoors and spent most our time
									staying at home. Inspired by the metro transit maps, we created this product
									displaying the major areas, furniture, and appliances in my rectangular apartment
									unit, connected by several fictive metro lines. Considering the geographic scale,
									the entire unit is regarded as an imaginary city, based on which many details are
									designed: the metro stations are named as individual places within a city; the order
									of the metro lines follows the progress of urban development; and the fixed boundary
									of city wall reflects the geographical barriers. Also, a locator map is made to
									provide broader geographic information, with designs turning the whole apartment
									building into an island country, with real lands as marine areas. Besides the
									laughter, we also hope this hilarious map could further raise some educational
									reminders, of the significance of practices to stay healthy and fight against the
									pandemic scientifically, such as wearing face masks, practicing social distancing,
									and using sanitizer.

									Covid Pandemic
									Dashboards
								</h2>
								<h5 class="text-muted">Honorable Mention, Digital Map Award in 48th CaGIS Map

								<br><br>
								<p>I made this interactive dashboard of Madison Area (Dane County) showing
									COVID-19
									Pandemic as well as relevant information from a geographic perspective. This
									dashboard is originally my volunteered product for community benefits,
									instead
									of seeking academic achievements, though I later got endorsed by my research
									lab
									(SCDM) led by Professor Qunying Huang. One of our research focuses is
									“spatial
									science for social good”, and we hope this product could be a practice of
									“Wisconsin Idea”, that university research should be applied to solve
									problems
									and improve the life of state citizens. Since all the data are available
									(from
									WI health department), and we happen to have the skills and experience in
									bettering visualizing these datasets, it is our duty and honor to serve our
									lovely local communities.<br><br>

									<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="maps/covid_dashboard_wlia.png" alt="">
									This map won the Best Student Map in <a
										href="https://www.wlia.org/news/a-virtual-2021-map-contest-with-real-awards"
										target=" _blank">Wisconsin Land Information Association (WLIA)
										Map Contest</a> (2021), and is the Honorable Mention of David Woodward Digital
									Map Award
									in <a
										href="https://cartogis.org/docs/map_competition/map_design_competition2020.pdf"
										target="_blank">48th CaGIS Map Design
										Competition</a> (2021).<br><br>
									<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="maps/covid_dashboard_cagis.png" alt="">
									Technically, I utilized Esri dashboard embedding ArcGIS Online interactive
									map
									to visualize the cumulative and weekly pandemic and relevant infographics in
									Dane County (such as university housing, major off-campus apartment,
									university
									and community testing sites). Most datasets are from the server of Wisconsin
									Department of Health Services. The entire platforms include desktop and
									mobile
									versions for Chinese and English interface, as well as a recently released
									statewide version with similar visualization but more options of
									administrative
									scale: census tract, zip code, sub-region (city, village, town), and school
									district. Infographics include growth chart and deaths proportion by sex,
									age,
									race, ethnicity, and hospitalization.<br><br>

									As a geography student, I think Wisconsinites should appreciate that our
									state
									government is willing to provide these datasets in an organized and
									scientific
									way (accurate enough in multiple levels, regular and frequent update, with
									historic data), together with satisfying consideration of privacy issue
									(e.g.
									hide the number of positive cases when a tract has less than 5 cases). As
									far as
									I know, over half of U.S. states only released county level data, and
									Wisconsin
									is the state with best public Covid data availability. Our story in Madison
									has
									already proved that even under similar overall patterns (Sep and Oct), the
									actual increase modes could be significantly different: centralized outbreak
									in
									Sep, distributed outbreak in Oct. Without data from a fine-enough geospatial
									scale, there is no way to make targeted, effective, and scientific
									policies.<br><br>

									Though I have some different opinions on how the state health department
									utilizes choropleth map to display total value, I don’t question their
									authority
									at all in leading us to fight against the pandemic. In this tough time,
									staying
									together is so important, and we should definitely show great respect
									and
									honor to WI Department of Health Service, Public Health Madison and Dane
									County,
									and UW-Madison’s relevant department including “Smart Restart Plan”. I hope
									my
									platform will become another useful tool in our toolkits, together with the
									WI
									DHS website, PHMDC Dashboard and UW-Madison COVID Dashboard. People are
									supposed
									to follow the official guidance and authorized information.
									<br><br>

									During an average day, there are about 500 daily visits from all platforms. The
